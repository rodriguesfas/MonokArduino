Monokai Arduino Theme
================

Revised for Arduino version 1.8.0+, not tested with earlier versions.

\- \- \-

####INSTALLATION
Look in `~/Applications/Arduino/lib` and replace the `theme` folder inside (making a copy of the original in case want to revert back).

####CREATING YOUR OWN MODS
The newest version of the Arduino IDE makes creating custom themes trickier: you now need to edit the `theme.txt` file, an XML file inside the `syntax` folder, and the button files. Unfortunately, not all items in the `theme.txt` file actually work, so if you can't get an item to change, try another one of the files.
